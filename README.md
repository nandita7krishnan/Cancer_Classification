# Breast Cancer Classification
This is a classsification problem aimed to identify and distinguish malignant cancer from benign, using measures of area, smoothness, texture etc., from a digitized image of a cell nuclei.

# Dataset
The dataset is taken from Kaggle repository - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

# Methodology
SEMMA approach was used in analyzing and modeling this particular dataset. More specifically, the following steps were taken :

**High-Level Data Analysis **: The dataset characteristics - dimension, missing values, data types were observed.
**Data Exploration :** Individual variables were analysed for patterns, and hidden correations.
**Modifications :** Outliers were removed and PCA was performed where necessary.
**Modeling :** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XG Boost was applied, and fit performance was evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall.
**Conclusion :** Best model was chosen based on the performance and evaluation metrics.
